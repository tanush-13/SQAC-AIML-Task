Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (Keras)

Task Overview -
This task implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on 28×28 grayscale images and can predict digits from custom images uploaded by the user.

Features - 
Train a CNN model on MNIST digits.
Predict digits from uploaded images.
Save and load trained models (.keras)
Visualize training accuracy and loss.

Dataset -
The project uses the MNIST dataset from tensorflow.keras.datasets, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28×28 pixels, grayscale.

Dependencies - 
Python 3,
TensorFlow / Keras,
NumPy,
Matplotlib,
OpenCV (cv2)
